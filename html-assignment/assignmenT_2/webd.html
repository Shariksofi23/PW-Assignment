        <p>
            Web development encompasses a broad spectrum of activities involved in building and maintaining websites on the internet. It involves a combination of skills in programming, design, and server management to create interactive and visually appealing online platforms. Front-end development focuses on the user interface and experience, utilizing languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure and style web content, making it responsive and engaging across various devices. This facet of web development ensures that websites are not only visually appealing but also function smoothly, providing seamless navigation and interactivity for users.

        <p>On the other hand, back-end development involves working with server-side languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js to manage databases, servers, and the application logic that powers the website. It deals with the behind-the-scenes functionalities that enable the front-end to interact with databases, perform calculations, process data, and deliver dynamic content to users. Back-end developers are responsible for creating the architecture that supports the website's functionality, ensuring it runs efficiently, securely, and smoothly. Additionally, full-stack developers possess expertise in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to work on all aspects of a web project, from designing the user interface to managing the server-side operations, providing a comprehensive approach to web development.
