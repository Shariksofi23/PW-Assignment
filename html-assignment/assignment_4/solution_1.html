    <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
    <h2>HTML5 introduced numerous features and improvements over its predecessors. Some of the key features of HTML5 include:</h2>
    <p>
        

1. <b>Semantics</b>: Introduction of new structural elements like `< header >`, `< footer >`, `< nav >`, `< article >`, `< section >`, `< aside >`, etc., which provide better clarity to the document structure, aiding both developers and search engines. <br>

2. <b>Audio and Video Support</b>: Native support for `< audio >` and `< video >` elements, enabling embedding and playback of multimedia content without requiring third-party plugins like Flash. <br>

3. <b>Canvas</b>: HTML5 introduced the `< canvas >` element, providing a scriptable surface for rendering 2D shapes and images using JavaScript. <br>

4. <b>SVG Support</b>: HTML5 added native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing the embedding of vector graphics directly into web pages. <br>

5. <b>Geolocation</b>: The Geolocation API allows browsers to access a user's geographical location, providing location-based services. <br>

6. <b>Web Storage</b>: HTML5 introduced the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's browser, providing more efficient and enhanced data storage compared to cookies. <br>

7. <b>Web Workers</b>: Enable running scripts in the background without affecting the performance of the web page. Web Workers allow for multitasking and concurrent processing by executing scripts in separate threads. <br>

8. <b>Offline Application Cache</b>: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (`AppCache`) API, allowing web applications to work offline by storing resources locally after the initial visit, thereby enhancing performance and user experience. <br>

9. <b>Responsive Design Support</b>: HTML5 supports responsive design practices with features like media queries, enabling developers to create web pages that adapt and respond to different devices and screen sizes. <br>

10. <b>Form Controls</b>: Introduction of new input types (e.g., `email`, `url`, `tel`, `number`, `date`, `time`, etc.) and attributes like `required`, `placeholder`, and `autocomplete`, making form validation and user interaction more efficient and user-friendly. <br>

11. <b>Drag and Drop</b>: HTML5 introduced native drag-and-drop support, allowing users to drag elements and drop them onto designated areas in web applications. <br>

12. <b>Web Sockets</b>: Facilitate real-time communication between a client and a server over a persistent connection, enabling bi-directional communication and efficient data exchange. <br>

These features have significantly contributed to the evolution of web development, enabling richer and more interactive web experiences. <br>
