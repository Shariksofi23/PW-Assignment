        2. **&gt;** - Greater than sign (`>`): Similar to the previous entity, this is used to display the greater than symbol `>` in HTML without it being interpreted as an HTML tag closing. <br>
        
        3. **&amp;** - Ampersand (`&`): This entity represents the ampersand symbol `&` and is used to display it in HTML without it being interpreted as the beginning of an entity. <br>
        
        4. **&quot;** - Double quotation mark (`"`): It represents the double quotation mark symbol `"` and is often used when including attributes or displaying text containing double quotes inside HTML attributes. <br>
        
        5. **&apos;** - Single quotation mark/apostrophe (`'`): This entity represents the single quotation mark or apostrophe `'`. It's used to display this character in HTML when needed, especially within attributes that already use double quotation marks. <br>
