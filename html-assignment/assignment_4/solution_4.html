    <h1>list ant 3 ways which help us in improving accessibility of html</h1>
    <p>
        Improving the accessibility of HTML involves various practices that ensure web content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, including those with disabilities. Here are three fundamental ways to enhance HTML accessibility: <br>

1. <b>Semantic HTML: </b>
   Using semantic HTML elements appropriately is crucial for accessibility. Semantic elements like `< header >`, `< footer >`,        `< nav >`, `< main >`, `< article >`, `< section >`, etc., provide clearer structure and meaning to the content. These elements assist screen readers and other assistive technologies in understanding the organization of the content, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and comprehend the information. <br>

2. <b>Proper Use of Alternative Text (Alt Text):</b>
   Providing descriptive and meaningful alt text for images using the `alt` attribute in HTML `< img >` tags is essential for users who rely on screen readers. Alt text should convey the purpose and content of the image accurately. It ensures that people with visual impairments can understand the context of the images on the web page. <br> 

3. <b>Keyboard Accessibility:</b>
   Ensure that all interactive elements and functionalities on a webpage are accessible and operable via keyboard navigation. Users with motor disabilities may rely solely on keyboard input. Elements such as links, buttons, form fields, and navigation menus should be navigable and operable using the "Tab" key, and their focus states should be clearly visible. Testing the site's functionality using only the keyboard is a critical step in ensuring keyboard accessibility. <br>

Implementing these practices in HTML is a fundamental step towards creating more accessible web content, making it easier for users with disabilities to access and interact with the information on websites and web applications.
