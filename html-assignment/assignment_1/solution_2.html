        Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML documents?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Comments in HTML serve the purpose of adding notes or annotations within the code that are not visible in the rendered output of the webpage. They are useful for developers to document the code, provide explanations, or temporarily disable certain parts without deleting them.
    </p>
    <h3>Comments in HTML are written using the following syntax: <!-- Your comment here -->
    </h3>
    <h3>Here's an example of how comments are used in an HTML document: 
    <h4>Welcome to my website</h4>
    <!-- This paragraph is temporarily disabled -->
    <!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden for now.</p> -->
    
    <p>Here is some visible content.</p>
    
    <!-- 
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It provides additional information about the code.
        You can write multiple lines within a comment.
    -->
    </h3>
    <p>
        In this example: <br>

Comments are enclosed between "<!-- and -->". <br>
They can be single-line or multi-line. <br>
You can use comments to temporarily disable certain parts of the code, like the paragraph that's commented out. <br>
Comments are useful for indicating sections of the code, such as marking the beginning or end of specific sections like the header or footer. <br>
Remember that comments in HTML are for developers and are not visible to users viewing the webpage in a browser. They are essential for code readability, understanding, and maintenance. <br>
