    <!-- What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HLTM" -->
    <p>The DOCTYPE declaration (short for Document Type Declaration) in HTML is an instruction that specifies the version of HTML (or sometimes XHTML) used in a web document. It is not a tag or an element; rather, it is a directive placed at the beginning of an HTML document to inform the web browser about the type of markup language used and how the document should be parsed.</p>
    <p>
        The DOCTYPE declaration is essential for the web browser to render the web page correctly by determining which rules and specifications to follow when interpreting the HTML code. It helps ensure compatibility and consistency in how the content is displayed across different browsers.
    </p>
    Example of a DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 : <br>
    <!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example HTML Document</title>
     Other HTML content
</head>
<body>
     Body content 
</body>
</html> -->
<p>In this example,  < !DOCTYPE html > is the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5. It informs the browser that the document is written in HTML5 syntax.</p>
<p>Different versions of HTML have their respective DOCTYPE declarations, and they vary based on the standards and rules defined for each version. The DOCTYPE declaration needs to be placed at the beginning of the HTML document before any other content to ensure proper rendering by web browsers.</p>
