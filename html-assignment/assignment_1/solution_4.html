    <h1>TAG:</h1>
    <p>
        A tag is a specific set of characters enclosed by angle brackets ('<' and '>') used to define elements within HTML. Tags are used to mark the beginning and end of an element and can contain attributes that provide additional information about the element. <br>
        Example of a tag: h1
            This is an opening tag for a heading level 1 (< h1 >) element. The corresponding closing tag would be < / h1 >. For instance:
    </p>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<hr>
    <h1>ELEMENT:</h1>
    <p>
        An element consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag. It represents a specific structure or part of a webpage. Elements can contain text, other elements, or be empty. <br>
        Example of an element:
    </p>
    <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
    <p> 
        <!-- is the opening tag. -->
        This is a paragraph element. is the content.
    </p> 
    <!-- is the closing tag. -->

    <hr>
    In the given example, the "p" element is used to create a paragraph on the webpage. <br>
<p>

    HTML elements are constructed using tags, with the opening and closing tags encapsulating the content that defines the element. Tags and elements form the backbone of HTML documents, enabling the organization and presentation of content on the web.
