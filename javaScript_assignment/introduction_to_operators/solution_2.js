let a=" In JavaScript, operators can be categorized based on their functionality. Here are the main categories along with examples for each:"
    
let Arithmetic_Operators={
    def:"arthemetic operators: Used for performing mathematical operations.",
    eg:"+ for addition",
    eg:"- for subtraction",
}

let Assignment_Operators={
    def:"assignment operators: Used to assign values to variables.",
    eg:"x += 5;  Equivalent to: x = x + 5;"   
    }

    let Comparison_Operators=
    {
        def:" comparison operators: Used to compare values.",
        eg:"c == d; Equal to"
}
let Logical_Operators={
    def:"logical oprators: Used to combine or invert logical expressions.",
eg:"(e && f);  Logical AND"
}

let Unary_Operators={
    def:"unary operators: Operate on a single operand.",
eg:"(-g);  Unary minus"}

let Conditional_Operator={ def:" conditional operator: A shorthand for an if...else statement.",
eg:"(age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'"}

let Bitwise_Operators={
    def:" bitwise operator: Used to perform bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers.",
eg:"(h & i); // Bitwise AND: 1"
}
