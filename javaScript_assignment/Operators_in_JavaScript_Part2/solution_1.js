let ternary="In JavaScript, the ternary operator is used to write conditional expressions in a concise way. Its syntax is similar to other languages 'condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse'"

let work="Here's how it works:condition: This is the condition that you want to evaluate. If the condition is true, the expression evaluates to expressionIfTrue, otherwise it evaluates to expressionIfFalse.expressionIfTrue: This is the value or expression that is returned if the condition is true.expressionIfFalse: This is the value or expression that is returned if the condition is false.Here's an example:"

let example="let isRaining = true; let action = isRaining ? 'Take an umbrella' : 'Leave the umbrella';console.log(action);"

console.log(ternary)
console.log(work)
console.log(example)


let a= 9
console.log(a)
let number=a/2==0 ? "number is even" : "number is odd"
console.log(number)
