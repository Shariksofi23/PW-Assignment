    usage:"In JavaScript, the comma operator , allows you to evaluate multiple expressions within a single statement. It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost expression. The primary use case for the comma operator is to include multiple expressions in locations where only a single expression is allowed, such as in a for loop's initialization or update section.",

    plain_syntax:"expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN",

    example_in_a_for_loop:"for (let i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {console.log('i:', i, 'j:', j);}    In this example, both i and j are initialized using the comma operator, and the loop continues as long as i is less than j. The i++ and j-- expressions in the update section of the for loop also use the comma operator to increment i and decrement j in the same statement."
