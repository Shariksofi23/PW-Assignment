let a="In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types:"


let data_types={
    Number: "The number type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. JavaScript uses the number type to represent all numeric values. For example:'let num = 42; // integerlet pi = 3.14; // floating-point number' ",

    String:" The string type represents sequences of characters, such as text. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example:  'let greeting = 'Hello, world!';'",
 
    Boolean: "The boolean type represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false. Booleans are often used in conditional statements. For example:'let isTrue = true;let isFalse = false;' ",

    Null:" The null type represents the intentional absence of any value or object. It is often used to initialize a variable that may later be assigned a value. For example: 'let emptyValue = null;'",

    Undefined: "The undefined type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. Variables are automatically assigned the value undefined when they are declared but not initialized. For example:'let undefinedValue;'"
}
