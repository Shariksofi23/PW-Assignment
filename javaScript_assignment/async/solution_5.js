1. **DOM (Document Object Model) API**:
   - Allows manipulation of HTML and XML documents. Developers can change the structure, style, and content of web pages dynamically.

2. **Fetch API**:
   - Provides an easy and logical way to make network requests (such as HTTP requests) and handle responses, replacing the older XMLHttpRequest.

3. **Canvas API**:
   - Enables drawing and manipulation of graphics and images within a web page using JavaScript. It's commonly used for game graphics, data visualization, and photo editing tools.

4. **Web Storage API**:
   - Consists of \`localStorage\` and \`sessionStorage\`, which allow developers to store data in the browser. \`localStorage\` stores data with no expiration date, while \`sessionStorage\` stores data for the duration of the page session.

5. **Geolocation API**:
   - Provides access to geographical location data associated with the userâ€™s device. This is commonly used for location-based services.

6. **History API**:
   - Allows manipulation of the browser session history. Developers can add, modify, or remove entries from the history stack.

7. **WebSockets API**:
   - Enables two-way interactive communication between the user's browser and a server. It's useful for real-time applications such as live chats, games, or stock tickers.

8. **Service Worker API**:
   - Provides the ability to intercept and control network requests, cache those requests, and deliver push messages. It's key for building progressive web applications (PWAs).

9. **Notification API**:
   - Allows web applications to display notifications to the user, even when the browser is not in focus, enhancing user engagement.

10. **File API**:
    - Gives web applications the ability to read, write, and manipulate files or directories on the user's device, making it possible to build complex file management interfaces.
