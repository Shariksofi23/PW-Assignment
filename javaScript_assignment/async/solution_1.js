### XMLHttpRequest Object

The \`XMLHttpRequest\` object allows web pages to make HTTP requests to servers asynchronously. This means parts of the webpage can be updated without needing to reload the entire page.

### Usage in AJAX

1. **Asynchronous Communication:** Allows data exchange between client and server without refreshing the page.
2. **Request Types:** Supports various HTTP methods like GET and POST.
3. **Handling Responses:** Can process different types of data such as text, HTML, JSON, and XML.
4. **Ready States:** Tracks the progress of a request with states from 0 (UNSENT) to 4 (DONE).
5. **HTTP Headers:** Manages HTTP headers for requests and responses.
6. **Error Handling:** Enables handling of errors and managing failed requests.

\`XMLHttpRequest\` is essential for creating dynamic, fast, and responsive web applications, enhancing the user experience by updating content seamlessly.
