        <p class="introduction">
            Global warming, a consequence of climate change, presents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. It refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's average temperature due to the release of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere. This phenomenon disrupts the planet's natural balance, leading to adverse environmental, social, and economic impacts.

        <h2>Causes of Global Warming:
        </h2>
        <!-- this div is named introduction because the content in it is about the causes of global warming -->
        <p class="causes">
            Human activities are the primary drivers of global warming. The burning of fossil fuels for energy production, industrial processes, transportation, and deforestation significantly contribute to the release of greenhouse gases. Additionally, agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and the use of chemical fertilizers, also release substantial amounts of methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere.

        <h2>Effects of Global Warming:</h2>
        <!-- this div is named introduction because the content in it is about the effects of global warming -->
        <p class="effects">
            The consequences of global warming are far-reaching and multifaceted. One of the most visible effects is the alteration of weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe natural disasters like hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and ecosystems, while disruptions in precipitation patterns impact agriculture, water resources, and food security. Furthermore, the warming of oceans contributes to the destruction of coral reefs and the loss of marine biodiversity. These effects not only harm the environment but also jeopardize human health, livelihoods, and economies worldwide.
