    <h1>Flexbox and CSS Grid are both layout models in CSS but serve different purposes and have distinct features:
    </h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>1. Flexbox:</th>
            <th>2. Grid:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.</td>
        <td>Designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing the creation of both rows and columns simultaneously.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Works along a single axis at a time (either horizontally or vertically).</td>
            <td>Supports the alignment and positioning of elements in both horizontal and vertical axes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Ideal for laying out items within a container in a flexible and dynamic way, especially for creating navigation menus, lists, or arranging items in a row or column.
            </td>
            <td> Enables more complex and comprehensive layouts, allowing precise control over rows, columns, and the placement of items within a grid.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Provides control over the alignment, ordering, and sizing of items within a container.</td>
            <td> Best suited for larger-scale layouts, like overall page structures or sections, where you need a more organized and structured design.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It is perfect for creating responsive designs, especially when dealing with smaller-scale layouts.</td>
            <td>It facilitates the creation of responsive designs but is more focused on larger-scale layouts with a defined grid structure.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h1>Choosing between Flexbox and Grid depends on the specific layout requirements:</h1>

<p> For simpler, one-dimensional layouts or arrangements in rows or columns, Flexbox is more suitable. For instance, creating navigation bars, aligning items within a container, or simple flexible layouts.</p>
  
<p>When dealing with complex, two-dimensional layouts with larger-scale designs, such as creating a complete webpage layout divided into sections or defining precise rows and columns, CSS Grid is the better choice. It offers more control over the overall layout structure.</p>

<p>In some cases, a combination of both Flexbox and Grid can be utilized within the same project, with each serving its specific purpose within different sections or elements of the layout, taking advantage of the strengths of each layout model.</p>
