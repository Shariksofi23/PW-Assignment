 <h1>version control system</h1>
 <p>   Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system that manages changes to a project's source code and other related files over time. It enables multiple contributors to work on a software development project simultaneously and helps keep track of the changes made to the codebase. The primary goals of version control are to:</p>
 <ol>
    <li>
       <b>Track Changes:</b> Version control systems (VCS) keep a record of every change made to the codebase, including additions, deletions, and modifications to files. This historical record allows developers to understand how the code has evolved over time.
    </li>
    <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Version control facilitates collaboration among team members. Multiple developers can work on different parts of a project simultaneously, and the version control system helps merge their changes seamlessly.</li>
    <li><b>Revert to Previous States:</b> If a mistake is made or an unexpected issue arises, version control allows developers to revert the codebase to a previous state. This is crucial for maintaining a stable and functional codebase.</li>
    <li><b>Branching and Merging:</b> Version control systems support branching, which allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase. Once the work is complete, branches can be merged back into the main codebase.</li>
    <li><b>Documentation and Collaboration:</b> Version control systems provide a platform for collaboration and communication among team members. Developers can leave comments, documentation, and annotations about specific changes, making it easier for others to understand the reasoning behind modifications.</li>
    <li><b>Auditing and Accountability:</b> Every change made to the codebase is logged in the version control system, providing a detailed history of who made the change, when it was made, and why. This accountability is essential for identifying the source of bugs or issues and for managing project contributions.</li>
    <li><b>Parallel Development:</b> Version control enables parallel development, allowing different teams or individuals to work on separate features or components simultaneously. This parallelism speeds up the development process.</li>
 </ol>


 <h1>Two common types of version control systems are:</h1>
<ol>
    <li><b>Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):</b> A central server stores the entire version history, and developers check out files from this central repository. Examples include CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and Subversion.</li>
    <li><b>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):</b> Each developer maintains a local copy of the entire repository, including its history. Changes can be made locally and later synchronized with other repositories. Examples include Git and Mercurial.</li>
</ol>
